# Contributing

Besfore any change please check projects and opened issues to verify if it is already being made.

Always open an issue before making any change so we can better track what is being made.
Issue must be named like: [KRF-*****] where ***** is the next available number for the issue.

Wait for aproval before starting so you don't dev anything that will be refused later.

All the code must be reviewed first by owner or somone selected by the owner. 


Flow of installation of new changes:

Create branch from master to Feature/ on new feature or BugFix/ to correct bug then your issue name like: Feature/KRF-00001

After dev is done, make pull request from your branch to integration and wait for review. Pass issue to tests

After code verified and merged to integration, you changes will be tested and in case of any problem you will get your issue in to correction state. 

Once it was tested sucessfully you'll be able to make pull request from your branch to Release/*.*. The release you should use will be defined by the owner.

After Release close, code will be merged to master. Release close is monthly but can change depending on quantity of features/fixes to shorter time (2 weeks minimal)


If you don't want to follow this rules, you can fork this project and make your own version of it. What matters is to have some fun while doing it :)
